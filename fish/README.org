Personal fish configuration. I am trying to make it fly!

* Dependencies

- =fish=
- =terminal-notifier= of version =1.6.2= or higher (OS X only)

As usual, these dependencies will be automatically bootstrapped during environment installation. But in any case, you should check [[https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/#building][official instructions]] on setting fish as your default shell.

* Batteries

There are some useful functions that come with my configs.

1. =__package_install PKG= - install =PKG= using =brew= if it's not yet installed (OS X only).
2. =dnvm= - wrapper for [[https://github.com/aspnet/dnvm][dnvm]].
3. =hglog= - pretty =log= for mercurial repository.
4. =mov_to_gif= - convert video file to gif. Video file must be supported by =ffmpeg=. Supports scaling. Dependencies will be installed on OS X automatically.
5. =cabal-install-bin=, =cabal-unpack-and-install-bin= - functions for safe binary packages installation using cabal. Deprecated since =stack= is out.
