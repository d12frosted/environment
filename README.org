This repository contains configurations for applications and tools I am using.

** What's inside?

All configurations that I fear to loose by making =rm -rf ~/= (accidentally, for
sure). Configurations are divided into domains like =emacs=, =git=, =haskell=,
=fish= etc.

All of the configurations as well as dependencies are maintained using Eru - a
script that creates the universe. Supported platforms are [[https://www.apple.com/macos][macOS]] and [[https://www.archlinux.org][Arch Linux]].

- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus][Emacs]] is my editor (see [[emacs/README.org][dedicated README]] for more information).
- [[https://fishshell.com][Fish]] is my shell.
- World is full of windows, and tiling window managers are here to ease the pain
  of existence.
  - [[https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai][yabai]] and [[https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd][skhd]] fulfill this role on macOS;
  - [[https://xmonad.org][xmonad]] with [[https://xmobar.org][xmobar]] are eXcellent choice.

** Eru domain

As you might know, Eru is the supreme deity of Arda. The first things that Eru
created where the Ainur. He then bade the Ainur to sing to him. Each Ainu had a
particular theme given by Eru. Sure enough, Eru makes the 'World and All That
Is'.

So when I get a new clean system there is nothing yet. And so I call upon the
wisdom and power of =Eru.sh= - the one who creates Ainur and the 'World and All
That Is'.

#+begin_src bash
  $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d12frosted/environment/master/eru.sh | bash
#+end_src

I just have to wait patiently, while everything is being downloaded and
installed, while all configuration cogs are being placed on the right spot.

#+begin_html
<p align="center">

</p>
#+end_html

The good thing about =Eru.sh= is that after the 'World and All That Is' creation
you can still call upon his help and you can even ask him to help with specific
theme or themes only.

#+begin_src bash
  $ ./eru.sh [install]                     # to help with all themes
  $ ./eru.sh install repositories          # to help with repositories
  $ ./eru.sh install repositories packages # to help with repositories and packages
  $ ./eru.sh install emacs                 # to help with emacs
  $ ./eru.sh upgrade emacs                 # to upgrade emacs packages
  $ ./eru.sh test emacs                    # to test emacs configurations
#+end_src

=Eru.sh= reveals all available themes. For example,

Everything wrapped into /beautiful/ rectangle is a theme that you can select. By
default, if you do not specify any themes, all themes are sung. If you do
specify at least one theme - only specified are sang.

You can read a little bit more about Eru in a [[https://d12frosted.io/posts/2018-11-04-revisiting-eru.html][Revisiting Eru]] blog post. Though
it might be already a little bit outdated.

** Emacs

Check out [[emacs/README.org][dedicated README]] for more information.

** Can I use your files?

Sure, just take whatever you find fancy. Though keep in mind few things. These
configurations are *personal* configurations, so they are based on my needs and
are opionated towards my liking. I don't test any of them outside of my use
case. I don't have a goal to provide exhaustive documentation, except for things
that worth the effort. Though I will be glad to help you if you have any
questions or problems. Pull requests and suggestions are warmly welcome!

If you do use any parts of my configurations, do it only on your own risk.
