This repository is a dump of my dotfiles that I am trying to keep clean and organized. But I prefer to call it 'environment'.

* What's inside?

All configurations that I fear to loose by making =rm -rf ~/= (accidentally, for sure). Configurations are divided into 'domains' like =emacs=, =git=, =haskell=, =fish= etc. Every domain has it's own readme file, so make sure to check them as well before running installation script. There is also =deprecated= 'domain'. There are things that are no more used but has little value for me.

* Dependencies

My configurations are expecting that a lot of stuff is installed on your system. As it was already told, every domain has it's own readme file where the full list of dependencies is written down.

But be aware that I am using OS X and haven't tested my configurations beyond this operating system. They should work, but I can't promise :smile:.

The installation script will try to get some of the dependencies if you are using OS X. Dependencies are installed via =bootstrap= script, which can be found in the root of =environment= and in some of domains. For example, root =bootstrap= script will install =brew= if you don't have one.

* Usage

The most important thing - you need to clone this repo into =~/.environment=. Otherwise fish and emacs will not work properly. I am using [[https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot][dotbot]] to bootstrap my configuration, so it's very easy to install them all. Just do

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ ./install
#+END_SRC

* Can I use your files?

Sure you can. But should you? :D

OK, jokes aside. It will be pleasure for me, if you find something useful in my configurations. I am trying to keep things as clear as possible, but sometimes I am making very urgent changes that I forget to document and sometimes I am just lazy to do so. So in case you have questions or any problems with my configurations - just ping me. Also be aware that I am not trying to make my configurations platform independent. You should check dependencies list or installation scripts.
