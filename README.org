This is my dotfiles. Be aware that this repository is not designed for general use. But probably you can check some of its part and steal what interests you.

[[https://travis-ci.org/d12frosted/environment.svg]]

* Usage

Use it on your own risk as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
curl -L https://github.com/d12frosted/d12frosted-environment/install.sh | zsh
#+END_SRC

It can take a while, because it installs:

- oh-my-zsh
- my personal zsh configs
- brew (OS X only)
- emacs (OS X only)
- my personal emacs configs
- ghc and cabal (from sources)
- some cabal packages

* Roadmap

- Add custom .ghci file (with docs and stuff)
- Merge zshrc configs repo with this one
- ~git submodule update --init~ could be dangerous
- dotbot
- emacs configurations
