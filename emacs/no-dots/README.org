#+TITLE: no-dots

Mirror of [[https://github.com/TheBB/spacemacs-layers/tree/master/no-dots][TheBB/no-dots]] layer.

By default it's impossible to ignore the dotted directories =.= and =..= in
=helm-find-files=, even if you use =helm-boring-file-regexp-list=. This layer
hacks it in, anyway.

Note that this works regardless of the value of =helm-ff-skip-boring-files= and
=helm-boring-file-regexp-list=. That functionality will continue to work as
before.
