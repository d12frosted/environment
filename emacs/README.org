Personal emacs configurations based on [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs][Spacemacs]]. Usually I use =d12frosted= branch of [[https://github.com/d12frosted/spacemacs][Spacemacs fork]]. But in most cases it should be OK to use official =develop= branch.

* Install emacs

For OS X users I recommend to install =emacs-mac= or =emacs=. You can find more information about different versions of Emacs on OS X in [[http://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/274/5161][this answer]].

These configurations were tested on =emacs-24.5-z-mac-5.10= and =GNU Emacs 25.0.50.1=.

** =emacs-mac=

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ brew install emacs-mac --with-spacemacs-icon --with-gnutls --with-imagemagick
#+END_SRC

** =emacs=

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ brew install emacs --HEAD --use-git-head --with-cocoa --with-gnutls --with-rsvg --with-imagemagick
#+END_SRC

* Run-time dependencies

Bootstrap script will install following dependencies.

- =ack=
- =ispell=

For haskell development you need to have following executables installed.

- =stack=
- =structured-haskell-mode=
- =hindent=
- =hlint=
- =ghc-mod=
- =stylish-haskell=
- =pandoc=
