Personal emacs configurations based on [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs][Spacemacs]]. Usually I use =d12frosted= branch of [[https://github.com/d12frosted/spacemacs][Spacemacs fork]]. But in most cases it should be OK to use official =develop= branch.

* Install emacs

The only tested version is =emacs-24.5-z-mac-5.10=. Usually I install it using following command.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ brew install emacs-mac --with-spacemacs-icon --with-gnutls --with-imagemagick
#+END_SRC

* Run-time dependencies

Bootstrap script will install following dependencies.

- =ack=
- =ispell=

For haskell development you need to have following executables installed.

- =stack=
- =structured-haskell-mode=
- =hindent=
