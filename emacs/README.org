Personal frustration and the biggest time waster in my life (comparable to video
games). Please, turn away and retain your sanity. Otherwise you might end up
tracking all your tasks, notes, thoughts and wine in Emacs.

Aside from configuring Emacs for my personal needs, this project has several
additional design goals in mind.

1. Byte compilation must succeed without any warnings.
2. Linter must be happy.
3. Loading must be fast (less than a second).
4. Ability to write applications that could be separate packages, but are too
   personal or too experimental to be worth the effort.
6. Ability to write and run tests.

In order to achieve these goals, the following approach is used.

1. All lisp files are divided into 3 categories.
   1. =init= files that configure built-in and external packages via
      =use-package= interface. They must not =require= (e.g. eagerly load) any
      packages that should be loaded lazily. All =init= files are required by
      main =init.el=.
   2. =config= files that contain configuration variables or constants. Safe to
      =require= from any place as they do not contribute much into loading time.
   3. =lib= files that should not be required directly from other files and
      should be loaded via =autoloads= file generated during build process.
      These files are fine to =require= any packages they need to make byte
      compiler happy.
2. All the build process, consisting of bootstrapping, =autoloads= generation,
   byte complication, linting, testing and upgrading is managed by [[https://github.com/doublep/eldev/][Eldev]]. See
   [[Eldev][Eldev]] file details.
3. Life cycle of configurations are install, upgrade and test. They are executed
   using [[../eru.sh][eru]] script. Read further for details.
4. [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el/][straight.el]] is used as a package manager instead of =package.el= or any other
   system. While being pretty complex, in my opinion it is the most stable and
   reliable package manager when it comes to installing and upgrading packages.
5. For better =flycheck= experience there is [[https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck-eldev][flycheck-eldev]].
6. [[https://github.com/gonewest818/elisp-lint][elisp-lint]] is used for linting, some custom rules applied (for
   =package-lint=).
7. Testing framework of choice is [[https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/emacs-buttercup][buttercup]].

** Dynamic and fast agenda

At the moment of writing this, I already have more than 10k org files. Most of
them do not contain any TODOs. When =org-agenda= is built, it needs to traverse
all these files. So the idea is to build =org-agenda-files= dynamically before
=org-agenda= is executed by marking files containing TODOs on file change and by
using wonderfully fast query capabilities of =org-roam=. You can read more at
[[https://d12frosted.io/posts/2021-01-16-task-management-with-roam-vol5.html][d12frosted.io]].

Points of interest:

- =lib-vulpea-agenda.el=
  - =vulpea-agenda-files-update= - a function that updates =org-agenda-files= to
    contain only files marked with =project= tag (e.g. containing TODOs).
- =lib-vulpea.el=
  - =vulpea-project-files= - a function to query the list of files marked with
    =project= tag (e.g. containing TODOs).
  - =vulpea-ensure-filetag= - a function that adds or removes =project= tag from
    current buffer depending on existence or absence of TODOs.
  - =vulpea-setup-buffer= and =vulpea-pre-save-hook= - functions that execute
    =vulpea-ensure-filetag=, used as hooks.
- =init-vulpea.el= - module that sets up all hooks (e.g. =org-agenda=,
  =before-save= and =window-buffer-change-functions=).

** Almost intelligent meeting capture flow

It is described in greater details at [[https://d12frosted.io/posts/2021-05-21-task-management-with-roam-vol7.html][d12frosted.io]], but in short, whenever a
meeting starts, I want to select a person I have a meeting with and capture
notes under =Meetings= outline in that persons file.

Points of interest:

- =lib-vulpea-capture-el=
  - =vulpea-capture-setup= - a function that sets up capture templates.
  - =vulpea-capture-meeting-template= - a function that prompts to select a
    person and depending on the result returns different templates.
  - =vulpea-capture-meeting-target= - a function that picks a target for
    captured note depending on selection from =vulpea-capture-meeting-template=.

** straight.el with retries

I have already covered this topic at [[https://d12frosted.io/posts/2021-04-08-straight-el-retries.html][d12frosted.io]]. In short, =init-elpa.el=
file contains functionality to automatically retry [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el/][raxod502/straight.el]]
operations. Take a look at definition and usage of =elpa-straight-with-retry=.

** Managing litnotes

#+begin_html
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/litnotes-1.png" width="100%"/>
</p>
#+end_html

Not so long ago I've started to take notes while I am reading books, articles,
listening to videos, or completing courses. Previously it was a scattered mess
(mostly left in my e-reading application), but now I have it all under
=litnotes= directory in my Org directory.

In order to list all my reading notes, I've built a solution based on
[[https://github.com/publicimageltd/lister][publicimageltd/lister]], [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea][vulpea]] and [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/][org-roam]] libraries. Take a look at
=lib-litnotes.el= file, your entry point is =litnotes= function.

Right now this buffer has minimal functionality:

- List all litnotes grouped by status (see =litnotes-status-values=).
- Configurable faces for each element.
- Tab expansion to hide or show specific group (e.g. status).
- Visiting note (=TAB= visits litnote in other window, =RETURN= visits in
  current window).
- Assign status to a note at point (by default, =s=).

More functionality to come:

- Ability to change default grouping (e.g. by content type, author or no
  grouping at all).
- Interactive sorting.
- Interactive filtering.

This is a playground for building more complex solution to support something
like [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vino][vino]].

* How to run

** Requirements

All requirements are installed by =eru=. But the full (and dramatically huge)
list of dependencies is here:

- Emacs 27 or higher - installed by =eru install system=.
- [[https://github.com/doublep/eldev][Eldev]] - installed by =eru install emacs=.

** Install Emacs

For OS X users I recommend to install [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus][emacs-plus]] (who would guess?) - GNU Emacs
with some sane defaults, available via [[https://brew.sh][brew]] package manager, though in general I
prefer (and highly recommend) using [[https://nixos.org/][nix]] or [[https://www.macports.org/][macports]] instead of [[https://brew.sh][brew]].

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus
$ brew install emacs-plus --HEAD
#+END_SRC

You are freeâ„¢ to use whatever Emacs variant you wish to use, though I don't give
any guarantees that it will work with these configurations. In case you wish to
investigate more on this topic, please refer to [[http://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/274/5161][this answer]].
