(defconst path-home-dir (file-name-as-directory (getenv "HOME"))
  "Path to user home directory.

In a nutshell, it's just a value of $HOME.")

(defconst path-config-dir

   (expand-file-name "emacs/" path-config-dir))
  "The path to this Emacs directory.")

(defconst path-autoloads-file

across systems.")

external dependencies or long-term shared data.")

Use this for files that change often, like cache files.")
