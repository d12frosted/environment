;; Various ID utilities.
;;
;; Automatic ID generation is controlled by `vulpea-id-auto-targets'.
;; It can be configured from init.el file, or from .dir-locals.el file
;; (for example ,to disable automatic generation):
;;
;;   ((org-mode . ((vulpea-id-auto-targets . nil))))
;;
;;; Code:

(require 'org-id)

(defvar vulpea-id-auto-targets '(file headings)
  "Targets for automatic ID assignment.

Each element of this list can be one of the following:

- file - to automatically set ID on the file level;
- headings - to automatically set ID for each heading in the file.

Empty list means no id assignment is needed.")

;;;###autoload
(defun vulpea-id-auto-assign ()
  "Add ID property to the current file.

Targets are defined by `vulpea-id-auto-targets'."
  (when (and vulpea-id-auto-targets
             (or (eq major-mode 'org-mode)
                 (eq major-mode 'org-journal-mode))
             (eq buffer-read-only nil))
    (save-excursion
      (widen)
      (goto-char (point-min))
